## About me:
I am a Well-organized and diplomatic person who likes to code and develop complex web applications and 
solve some real-life problems. Currently, I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Computer Science at Fast University Islamabad, Class of 2025. At there, I'm in the
process of polishing my critical thinking and other skills and experimenting with different technologies that grab my interest.
